# node-red-examples
Look under "import". The examples supplied by node-red can be found there!</br>
I created the examples in this repository because I had problems with a number of packages / functions. </br>
I hope this will help you :-)

* ping_flow_with_dashboard</br>
    Ping Target, show Result in Dashboard
    
* screenshot_tesserract</br>
    Take Screenshot an analyse Text with Tesseract
    
* powershell_ping_with_dashboard
    Ping Target over Powershell, show Result in Dashboard</br>
    -> You need to manually update powershell.js, cause the installed package has not the newest version

* powershell_with_much_sourcecode
    Execute Scripts which are more than "One-Liners"
